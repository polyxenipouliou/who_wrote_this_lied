# Who Wrote this Lied? A Computational Approach to Lied Classification and Composer Fingerprinting

## Abstract

This project investigates whether individual composer style can be captured through computational analysis of symbolic music representations. We propose a four-layer feature framework combining **tonal tension** (Spiral Array Model), **harmonic complexity** (pitch class entropy), **pianistic texture** (onset density) and **melodic contour** (voice interval variation) to classify Lieder by Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, and Johannes Brahms. Our experiments demonstrate that statistical descriptors from musicologically driven features achieve approximately 49% balanced accuracy using a Support Vector Machine classifier. This significantly outperforms both SVM (47.1%) and MLP (45.3%) classifiers on 768-dimensional pretrained transformer embeddings from Adversarial-MidiBERT on our 264-piece corpus.

## Dataset

| Composer | Number of Lieder | Percentage |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| Franz Schubert | 84 | 31.8% |
| Johannes Brahms | 109 | 41.3% |
| Robert Schumann | 71 | 26.9% |
| **Total** | **264** | **100%** |

**Data Sources:**

## Feature Sets

### 1. Statistical Features (12D)
Derived from the three-layer theoretical framework:
- **Tonal Tension** (`tt_mean`, `tt_std`, `tt_entropy`): Euclidean distance in Spiral Array space
- **Harmonic Complexity** (`hc_mean`, `hc_std`, `hc_entropy`): Pitch class distribution entropy
- **Melodic Contour** (`mc_mean`, `mc_std`, `mc_entropy`): Interval succession statistics
- **Pianistic Texture** (`pt_mean`, `pt_std`, `pt_entropy`): Onset density per beat

### 2. MidiBERT Embeddings (768D)
Pre-trained transformer representations extracted using [Adversarial-MidiBERT](https://github.com/RS2002/Adversarial-MidiBERT).

## Musicological Interpretation

### What Features Reveal About Composer Style

**Franz Schubert:**
- Higher stepwise ratio (f28) reflects lyrical, vocal melody writing
- Lower texture density aligns with guitar-like accompaniment patterns
- Moderate harmonic complexity supports text expression

**Robert Schumann:**
- Higher texture variation (pt_std) indicates diverse accompaniment patterns
- Higher staccato ratio (f22) suggests varied articulation
- Complex rhythmic patterns reflect poetic declamation

**Johannes Brahms:**
- Higher pitch range (f4) indicates richer textures
- Conservative interval patterns (f27_unison_ratio) reflect classical influence
- Dense chordal writing shows symphonic piano writing

## Methodological Notes

### Note Count Exclusion
Note count (f1) was initially included as a feature but was removed because it serves as a proxy for piece length, which may confound stylistic analysis with formal/structural choices unrelated to composer-specific musical language.

### Velocity Feature Exclusion
Velocity features (f11-f15) were excluded because MIDI velocity values in symbolic datasets often reflect editorial conventions of score transcribers rather than composer intent. Historical scores from the Romantic era specify dynamics qualitatively (e.g., *p*, *f*) rather than as numerical values (1-127).
